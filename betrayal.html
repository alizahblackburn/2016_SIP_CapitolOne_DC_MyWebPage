		<strong><p>Do you realize how much it hurts?</p>
		<strong><p>No, of course not. </p>
		<strong><p>I don't understand how you could do that to me </p>
		<strong><p>After all I have done for you.</p>
		<strong><p>From the very beginning.</p>
		<strong><p>You don't care, do you?</p>
		<strong><p>All you care about is what she thinks, </p>
		<strong><p>what she wants.</p>
		<strong><p>Never what is good for us.</p>
		<strong><p>If only you could see how much this is affecting our family.</p>
		<strong><p>Maybe you would change.</p>
		<strong><p>You only see what you want to see </p>
		<strong><p>And I can't be there for you anymore.</p>
		<strong><p>I can't help you get through this </p>
		<strong><p>Unless you stop fighting me with all you have.</p>
		<strong><p>You have pushed me so far away from you, </p>
		<strong><p>I don't even know who you are anymore.</p>
		<strong><p>I still love you.</p>
		<strong><p>If only you could see that through the thick wall you have built.</p>

		<strong><p>His skin is as brittle as a croissant.</p>
		<strong><p>His pace as slow as a snail. </p>
		<strong><p>He is as tall as a tree.</p>
		<strong><p>And He is as slim as a toothpick.</p>
		<strong><p>He is my grandpa and i'll have him no other way.</p>
		<strong><p>He is as intelligent as a dolphin.</p>
		<strong><p>He is as wise as an owl.</p>
		<strong><p>And he is as sweet as a chocolate bar.</p>
		<strong><p>He is my grandpa and I love him.</p>

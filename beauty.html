		<strong><p>It's the bright golden rays of sunshine,</p>
		<strong><p>Streaming through the leaves </p>
		<strong><p>And the warmth as it envelopes you. </p>
		<strong><p>It's the lady who spends all morning nursing the homeless</p>
		<strong><p>And the dog welcoming you home.</p>
		<strong><p>It's accepting his faults</p>
		<strong><p>And play fighting.</p>
		<strong><p>It's the blanket of silence just before the storm</p>
		<strong><p>And the rainbow once it has passed.</p>
		<strong><p>It's food fights</p>
		<strong><p>And ice cream dripping through your fingers.</p>
		<strong><p>It's pulling through tough times</p>
		<strong><p>And eating chocolate cake.</p>
		<strong><p>It's floating on the smooth surface of the pool</p>
		<strong><p>And listening to blasting music.</p>
		<strong><p>It's crying over someone you've lost</p>
		<strong><p>And remembering the good times you had.</p>
		<strong><p>Beauty is everywhere.</p>
		<strong><p>You just need to know where to look.</p>

		<strong><p>If you ever feel less than perfect </p>
		<strong><p>Just call my name and I will save you from the dark.</p>
		<strong><p>Don't let anyone else speak the words on your lips.</p>
		<strong><p>You can be more like you and less like everyone else.</p>
		<strong><p>We are only human</p>
		<strong><p>When we fall we bleed but words won't bring us down.</p>
		<strong><p>Together we can make it through another day.</p>
		<strong><p>You are beautiful no matter what they say.</p>
		<strong><p>Words won't bring you down.</p>
		<strong><p>Our demons hide in our eyes.</p>
		<strong><p>When you look into them you can see our pain.</p>
		<strong><p>Whatever doesn't kill you makes you stronger.</p>
		<strong><p>Together we will walk towards the light.</p>

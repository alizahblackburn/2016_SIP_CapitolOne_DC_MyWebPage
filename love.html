		<strong><p>People believe love is your boyfriend or girlfriend, but it's more than that.</p>
		<strong><p>Love is your mom tucking you in at night.</p>
		<strong><p>It's being allowed to lick the frosting off the spoon.</p>
		<strong><p>It's eating icecream on the beach.</p>
		<strong><p>Love is the dog snoring on the couch.</p>
		<strong><p>It's holding on even though it hurts.</p>
		<strong><p>It's sticking together even though everyone else is trying to pry you apart.</p>
		<strong><p>That is love.</p>

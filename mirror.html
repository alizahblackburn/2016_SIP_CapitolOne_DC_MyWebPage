		<strong><p>When I look in the mirror,</p>
		<strong><p>I see a girl who doesn't believe in herself.</p>
		<strong><p>I see an ugly no good loser.</p>
		<strong><p>When I look in the mirror, </p>
		<strong><p>I see a girl who doesn't have any friends.</p>
		<strong><p>I see a girl who is lost.</p>
		<strong><p>When I look in the mirror,</p>
		<strong><p>I see a girl who doesn't love herself.</p>
		<strong><p>I see a girl who wishes she was someone else.</p>
		<strong><p>When I look in the mirror</p>
		<strong><p>I see a girl who fakes a smile,</p>
		<strong><p>so no one can see how much she hurts on the inside.</p>
		<strong><p>I see a girl who wants to be accepted.</p>
		<strong><p>When I look in the mirror</p>
		<strong><p>I see a girl who wants to fit in.</p>
		<strong><p>I see a girl who may never be loved or accepted.</p>

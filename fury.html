		<strong><p>His eyes, the color of spun gold,</p>
		<strong><p>Burn into mine with an inner fury. </p>
		<strong><p>It pours off of him in waves of heat, </p>
		<strong><p>As the shouts and commotion interrupt his peace.</p>
		<strong><p>I watch as his tightly coiled muscles,</p>
		<strong><p>Glide beneath his glistening skin as he paces.</p>
		<strong><p>Left, one, two, three, paces.</p>
		<strong><p>Right, one, two, three, paces.</p>
		<strong><p>And left again.</p>
		<strong><p>There is no rest for him</p>
		<strong><p>While it is daylight.</p>
		<strong><p>He will be here all day.</p>
		<strong><p>Paceing</p>
		<strong><p>Trying to contain his fury.</p>
		<strong><p>There is no peace for him,</p>
		<strong><p>Until the last tourist is gone,</p>
		<strong><p>The gates close,</p>
		<strong><p>The lock clicks into place,</p>
		<strong><p>The lights go out one by one,</p>
		<strong><p>Then, only then,
		<strong><p>Will he find peace,
		<strong><p>will he relax.
		<strong><p>Until tomorrow,
		<strong><p>When the cycle begins again.</p>

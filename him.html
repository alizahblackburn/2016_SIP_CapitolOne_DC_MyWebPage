		<strong><p>I love his passion for gaming,</p>
		<strong><p>His smile when he catches me staring, </p>
		<strong><p>His eyes when he watches me.</p>
		<strong><p>I love when he holds me,</p>
		<strong><p>When he tells me he loves me,</p>
		<strong><p>When he pulls me into his lap.</p>
		<strong><p>I love that he's organized,</p>
		<strong><p>That he's smart,</p>
		<strong><p>That he thinks of me.</p>
		<strong><p>I love his hands,</p>
		<strong><p>When I have to stand on my tiptoes to kiss him,</p>
		<strong><p>When we go for walks.</p>
		<strong><p>I love that he cares about me,</p>
		<strong><p>That he asks me about my day,</p>
		<strong><p>That he tells me how he feels.</p>
		<strong><p>I love that he respects me,</p>
		<strong><p>That he doesn't pressure me,</p>
		<strong><p>That he doesn't push me.</p>
		<strong><p>I love everything about him.</p>
		<strong><p>Though sometimes that scares me.</p>
		<strong><p>I don't want to be hurt again.</p>
		<strong><p>To be tossed aside again.</p>
		<strong><p>To be cheated on again.</p>
		<strong><p>To be forgotten again.</p>
		<strong><p>I don't want my love to go to waste,</p>
		<strong><p>Not again.</p>
		<strong><p>It's hard trusting him with my feelings,</p>
		<strong><p>Though I still do.</p>
		<strong><p>I just worry because</p>
		<strong><p>I love him.</p>
